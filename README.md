# Novel Summarizer 

The MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) method is a technique commonly used in natural language processing and text summarization to create concise and informative summaries of longer texts, such as novels. Each sentence's relevance to the overall content of the novel is determined based on various factors such as frequency of occurrence. It aims to include sentences that cover a wide range of topics or perspectives to provide a comprehensive summary. Using a combination of relevance and diversity scores, the MMR algorithm selects a subset of sentences to include in the summary. These sentences should be highly relevant to the novel's content while also offering a diverse representation of its themes and ideas.
